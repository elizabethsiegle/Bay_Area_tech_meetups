# Comprehensive Guide to Bay Area Tech meetups
###### **Pull requests are very much welcomed**
Do you want to
+ get better at programming? :computer:
+ network
+ improve job prospects
+ listen to cool talks
+ meet amazing people.

WELL THEN…you should go to some tech meetups all over the Bay Area! But there's so many, you protest!

As a summer intern in *SoMa*, I attended up to four meetups a week sometimes because I loved the lively discussions with engineers, evangelists, designers, students, and meeting people from all over the globe. I relished office visits, swag, raffles, talks, workshops, and just the atmosphere in general.

I have been to most of the meetups listed here, and heard of all of these—you can probably tell the ones I enjoy and recommend based on emoji usage!

## Find meetups :collision:
With an endless supply of meetups (not just tech-related), and meetups all over the world, [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) is A+. Many of the meetups here are monthly, weekly, or meet routinely. Similarly, I also recommend [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) also has a few, which I often find in tech related groups (Hackathon Hackers, Ladies Storm Hackathons, but more often, in their subgroups, often targeted at location or platform ie iOS, web, IoT, etc.)

:fire:

Add people on LinkedIn and Twitter. Don’t be afraid to ask for business cards or emails or anything. Chances are, you’ll see these people at future meetups, or at other tech meetups around SF. I’m surprised at how tight-knit some of the meetups, or developer community/ies in general are!

## Speaking

+ Web: [React Native](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKi1v_49wcobNZjfC5ELZV0dZvORZ4ZEGsf4iiDTAtCS5gzw/viewform?c=0&w=1), [WaffleJS](https://wafflejs.com/speakers)

+ Mobile: [Android, iOS, and more](https://goo.gl/forms/wZMyz6xNsg6ZA5173)

## Conclusion

There are so many meetups to choose from, both in and out of the Bay Area. Go for the people, go for the community, and go to learn from not just speakers, but attendees. Yes, you can network, but there's so much knowledge to gain and also impart on others.

*TODO*: Been to any meetups? Heard of any good ones? Well, then fork this repo, submit some pull requests, and contribute!
